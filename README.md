### Digiwhiteboard is a remake of my graduation project for my diploma programme in Saskatchewan Polytechnic. The original project was to build an application for the Royal University Hospital Orthopaedic Operating Room to display patients' health care information in a table format for reference of the health care practiioners there. It is now remade as a web application developed by Django web framework. Users are able to create, read, update and delete the patients' health care information and displayed in tabular form. All information is stored in Django's built-in database, SQLite. Django authentication system has been setup to restrict access to authorized personnel only.
